About Second Story
<br>Second Story is an online publication that aims engages in meaningful storytelling through the means of examining a building’s past and present. Meant for readers who desire to look beyond the surface of the everyday, Second Story examines buildings in New York City’s present, searching for mysteries, memories, and magic in their past.
        
<br> Each issue of Second Story focuses on a specific building, using the geographical location as a jumping-off point for visual, literary, and narrative inspiration. Second Story is not a research magazine or a historical archive rather a magazine in support of the visual and literary arts. The publication is process-based and embraces the organic nature of discovery in relation to the buildings it highlights.
        
<br>We hope you enjoy this issue. Please contact us at yourstory@secondstory.com with any comments, suggestions, or inquiries.
