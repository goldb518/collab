      GENERATIONS APART

      <p>“We have a history of associating ourselves somehow in the garment industry,” said Aaron Silver to me over the phone. After an hour-long conversation with my grandfather, it became clear to me that my grandfather and I led surprisingly similar daily lives, centered around the same building, a mere two generations apart.
      </p>
      <p>Aaron Silver was the child of Jewish immigrants who came to America in the early twentieth century, following the warning of Joseph Rosen, known as the Rogatchover Gaon, after a series of Pogroms in Ukraine. Born in the East Village, Manhattan he found his first internship in 1951, at the age of seventeen, at Bernard Joseph Inc. which was located then at 80 Fifth Avenue. My grandfather received the job through a connection from his brother-in-law and worked at the company, which specialized in outergarments, sweeping the floor, taking care of the office, and observing the manner in which the garments were put together.
      </p>
      <p>Describing in detail the landscape of the garment industry at the time, my grandfather recalls how there was an everyone-knows-everyone mentality about the different companies, many of which were located in 80 Fifth Avenue. To the outsider, it seemed that garments were made by disparate companies and workers who worked in isolation, but to those in the industry, they could tell you exactly who made each piece of the garment and what their name was. My grandfather describes how at lunchtime, Union Square Park would become a scene to highlight this fact, where everyone from the garment industry would gather to eat lunch amidst their busy days.
      </p>
      <p>Enlightened to the world of my grandfather at seventeen, I began to think of the daily routines I undergo that center around 80 Fifth Avenue. Since beginning my undergraduate education at Parsons School of Design, 80 Fifth Avenue has been a landmark of the intersection that makes up the campus. It’s location directly across from the 63 Fifth Ave, the building where I spend most of my working time, serves as an apt physical allusion to the generational gap that separates my time and my grandfather’s time along Fifth Avenue.
      </p>
      <p>At the time that I decided to attend a university devoted to a pursuit in the field of art and design, I had no idea that my relocation to New York would be one that followed in the footsteps of generational precedent. I imagine myself and my grandfather, each working throughout the day to create beautiful products, in buildings across the street from each other, separated by nothing but the concrete of Fifth Avenue and the confines of time.</p><span class="Helvetica">—</span><span class="signature">Bentzion Goldman</span>
