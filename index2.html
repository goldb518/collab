          Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
          And sorry I could not travel both
          And be one traveler, long I stood
          And looked down one as far as I could
          To where it bent in the undergrowth;

          I shall be telling this with a sigh
          Somewhere ages and ages hence:
          Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
          I took the one less traveled by,

          Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
          Though as for that the passing there
          Had worn them really about the same,

          In leaves no step had trodden black.
          Oh, I kept the first for another day!
          Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
          I doubted if I should ever come back.
